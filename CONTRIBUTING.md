Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to CheckFreq!

The main [README.md](README.md) contains instructions on how to build and  run CheckFreq on a few simple models.

You must sign a Contribution License Agreement (CLA) in order to have a PR merged. This a one-time requirement for Microsoft projects in GitHub. You can read more about [Contribution License Agreements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement) (CLA) on Wikipedia.

However, you don't have to do this up-front. You can simply clone, fork, and submit your pull-request as usual.

When your pull-request is created, it is classified by a CLA bot. If the change is trivial (i.e. you just fixed a typo) then the PR is labelled with cla-not-required. Otherwise, it's classified as cla-required. In that case, the system will also tell you how you can sign the CLA. Once you have signed a CLA, the current and all future pull-requests will be labelled as cla-signed.
